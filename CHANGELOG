CHANGELOG for the NEL tool

v. current (0.4.0) (2021-July-22):
 * Add an option to simulate a regular warden by defining a
   fraction of CCs that are blocked (by simply preventing
   their probe packets being sent. Made sure time consumption
   is similar to regular sending.
 * Added option to simulate a regular warden.
 * Added option to simulate a *simplified* adaptive warden.
 * Remove unnecessary cs.h
 * Put some macro checks in separate file so that some major
   configuration mistakes are caught.
 * Tell the CR about the configuration (type of warden and its
   settings) so that it can be displayed when NEL phase is
   completed to ease the analysis process. This is useful in
   combination with a typescript (see script(1)).
 * Fixed several (minor) bugs and performed code clean-ups;
   improved inline documentation.

v. 0.2.5:
 * slightly updated the markdown files (also pointed out the
   idea of the dynamic warden)
 * performed some tiny improvements of the documentation

v. 0.2.4:
 * Changed several details in terms of the packet counting and
   general NEL parameters.
 * Changed utilization of libpcap.
 * Improved documentation.

v. 0.2.1-0.2.3:
 * Improved several aspects of the documentation
 * Added several new rules provided by Mehdi Chourib

v. 0.2.0 : 2017-05-06
 * Initial public release (github)
